This is the code for the ICLR 2025 paper:  
[**Multimodal Quantitative Language for Generative Recommendation**](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=v7YrIjpkTF)

## Setup

> pytorch==2.1.0  
transformers <= 4.45.0  

- We found that different versions of **transformers** significantly impact convergence speed and performance under default parameters.  
For newer versions, parameter adjustments are required.

We tested different transformers versions with accelerate==0.28.0:  
- v4.47.0, 4.48.0, 4.50.0
![alt text](figures/2.png)  

- v4.38.2, 4.39.0, 4.40.0, 4.45.0

- v4.46.0 shows high training loss

v4.43.0, 4.44.0 are incompatible with accelerate==0.28.0 - version change required.

## Quick Start

### Data Processing
```
cd data_process
```
1. Download images  
2. Process data to ensure each item corresponds to one image and one text description  
3. Generate text embeddings  
4. Generate image embeddings
